# Population dynamics of freshwater microorganisms
This is the repository for a project in the course Applied Bioinformatics. 

Building on the work of Hoetzinger <em>et al.</em> (2021), the main goal of the project is to study the influence of dispersal limitation on the population structures of 21 bacterial species from intercontinetal freshwater lakes. This was done by achieving the following subgoals: 

* Created a dataset of metagenomes from databases covering a variety of freshwater habitats on an intercontinetal scale.
* Calculated population differentiation (Fst values) using POGENOM.
* Determined relationships between geographic locations and FST values with Mantel tests.
* Created a pipeline that automated the prescreening step before running POGENOM.
